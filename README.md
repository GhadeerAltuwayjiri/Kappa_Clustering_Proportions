# Kappa Clustering Proportions

This project evaluates the average cluster proportions in clustering results with and without the application of different kappa values. It generates metrics and plots to compare the cluster proportions across various covariance simulations (`cov_sim`).

## Usage

### Requirements

#### R
Ensure you have the following packages installed in R:
- `MASS`
- `flowClust`
- `latex2exp`
- Any other dependent packages (e.g., `flowCore`)

#### Python
Ensure you have the following packages installed in Python:
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

### How to Run

#### R

To run the R code, open the `R/kappa_clustering_proportions.R` file in your R environment and source it.

#### Python

To run the Python code, open the `Python/kappa_clustering_proportions.py` file and execute it in your Python environment.

### Code Explanation

#### R Code

The R script `kappa_clustering_proportions.R` calculates average cluster proportions for different kappa values and covariance simulations (`cov_sim`). It then generates plots to compare the average cluster proportions.

#### Python Code

The Python script `kappa_clustering_proportions.py` (to be created similarly to the R script) will follow a similar process. It calculates average cluster proportions for different kappa values and covariance simulations (`cov_sim`) and generates plots to compare the average cluster proportions.
